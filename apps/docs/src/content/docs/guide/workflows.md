Workflows are useful when your application needs an agent to complete a single unit of work without an ongoing conversation, such as a background job, document transformation, code review, or CI task. This guide covers creating a workflow, controlling its execution in code, and inspecting its result. If you need an agent that continues accepting messages over time, see [Agents](/docs/guide/building-agents/).

## Creating a new workflow

In a Flue project, a workflow is a file in `src/workflows/` that exports a `run(...)` function. The filename gives the workflow its name: `src/workflows/summarize.ts` defines the `summarize` workflow.

```ts title="src/workflows/summarize.ts"
import { createAgent, type FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';

const summarizer = createAgent(() => ({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5',
  instructions: 'Summarize the supplied document clearly and concisely.',
}));

export async function run({ init, payload }: FlueContext<{ text: string }>) {
  const harness = await init(summarizer);
  const session = await harness.session();
  const response = await session.prompt(payload.text);

  return { summary: response.text };
}
```

In this example:

- **The filename:** This gives the workflow its name: `summarize`.
- `createAgent(...)`: This defines the agent used to perform the work.
- `run(...)`: This is the unit of work Flue runs for each invocation.
- `init(summarizer)`: This initializes the created agent for this workflow invocation and returns its harness.
- `harness.session()`: This opens the default session used for the operation.
- **The return value:** This becomes the completed workflow result.

A workflow can contain ordinary TypeScript logic before, between, or after agent operations: load application data, branch on input, log progress, or transform a response before returning it. Configure the agent's model, instructions, tools, skills, and sandbox through `createAgent(...)`, as you would for an addressable agent.

See [Project Layout](/docs/guide/project-layout/) for supported source layouts, [Models & Providers](/docs/guide/models/) for model configuration, and [Agents](/docs/guide/building-agents/) for agent configuration concepts.

## Running a workflow

Each time a workflow is invoked, Flue creates a **workflow run** with a unique `runId`. The run captures its completed result or error and can include events from the agent operations performed inside `run(...)`.

### Local execution

Use `flue run` to execute a discovered workflow locally or from CI. The workflow does not need to be exposed over HTTP or WebSockets:

```bash
pnpm exec flue run summarize --target node --payload '{"text":"Flue workflows complete finite agent-backed operations."}'
```

`flue run` reports the run identity and events, and prints the successful workflow result as JSON. Local execution currently builds and runs the Node target.

### HTTP

Export `route` when callers should invoke the workflow over HTTP:

```ts title="src/workflows/summarize.ts"
import type { WorkflowRouteHandler } from '@flue/runtime';

export const route: WorkflowRouteHandler = async (_c, next) => next();
```

An exposed `summarize` workflow accepts requests at `POST /workflows/summarize`. The route middleware is also the boundary where your application can authenticate or reject an incoming request before starting a run.

### WebSocket

Export `websocket` when a caller should receive live activity for one workflow invocation over a socket:

```ts title="src/workflows/summarize.ts"
import type { WorkflowWebSocketHandler } from '@flue/runtime';

export const websocket: WorkflowWebSocketHandler = async (_c, next) => next();
```

A workflow WebSocket carries one finite invocation and completes with that run. It is not a continuing conversation with an agent instance.

For HTTP response modes, WebSocket invocation, authentication, and custom application mounts, see [Routing](/docs/guide/routing/).

## Working with the harness

`init(agent)` returns a harness: the initialized environment your workflow uses for that agent. Through the harness, application code can prepare the agent's workspace and open sessions where the agent performs work.

### Files and commands

A workflow can provide files for an agent to work on and collect the generated artifact after it finishes:

```ts title="src/workflows/review-document.ts"
import { createAgent, type FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';

const reviewer = createAgent(() => ({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6',
  cwd: '/workspace',
}));

export async function run({ init, payload }: FlueContext<{ document: string }>) {
  const harness = await init(reviewer);
  await harness.fs.writeFile('document.md', payload.document);

  const session = await harness.session();
  await session.prompt('Review document.md and write your findings to review.md.');

  return { review: await harness.fs.readFile('review.md') };
}
```

`harness.fs` lets your application stage inputs and retrieve output files in the agent's workspace. Use `harness.shell(...)` when application code needs to prepare or inspect that workspace with a command before the agent works in it. These are workflow-controlled setup steps; they do not add messages to the session conversation.

The workspace available to a harness is determined by the agent's sandbox configuration. See [Sandboxes](/docs/guide/sandboxes/) for filesystem and execution environments.

### Sessions

A session is where the agent's work accumulates context. Use the default session when a later instruction should continue from earlier work:

```ts title="src/workflows/investigate-incident.ts"
import { createAgent, type FlueContext } from '@flue/runtime';

const investigator = createAgent(() => ({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6',
}));

export async function run({ init, payload }: FlueContext<{ incident: string }>) {
  const harness = await init(investigator);
  const session = await harness.session();

  await session.prompt(`Analyze this incident:\n\n${payload.incident}`);
  const response = await session.prompt('Now recommend the next three actions.');

  return { recommendation: response.text };
}
```

In addition to prompting, a session can run an available skill, delegate a task to a configured subagent, or execute a command that later agent work should know about. See [Prompting](/docs/guide/prompting/) for operation results, [Skills](/docs/guide/skills/) for reusable procedures, and [Subagents](/docs/guide/subagents/) for delegated work.

## Managing workflow runs

A `runId` lets you inspect a workflow independently of the command, HTTP request, or WebSocket connection that started it. This is useful for background work, live progress, debugging, and operational tooling.

| Surface | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `flue logs <runId>` | Inspect or follow events for a workflow run from the command line. |
| `GET /runs/<runId>` | Read one run's status and its completed result or error when available. |
| `GET /runs/<runId>/events` | Read persisted lifecycle, log, and nested agent-operation events. |
| `GET /runs/<runId>/stream` | Replay persisted events and follow an active run through completion. |
| `client.runs.get()`, `.events()`, and `.stream()` | Build application tooling around a known workflow run. |
| `client.admin.runs.list()` | List workflow runs for protected administrative tooling. |

Administrative run listing can reveal workflow payloads, results, model activity, and application logs. Only publish an administrative listing surface behind an authorization boundary appropriate for that data.

Only workflows create workflow runs. Direct HTTP or WebSocket prompts to an agent instance, and asynchronous input delivered through `dispatch(...)`, are operations in persistent agent sessions; they are not queried through workflow run history or `flue logs`.
